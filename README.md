# WARNING: The following repository is in NO WAY an official OpenArena repository. If you need to check the latest content, go these ways:

* First and foremost, the OpenArena official forum: http://www.openarena.ws/board
* Game content: do a SVN checkout on http://openarena.ws/svn
* Engine code: do a Git clone on https://github.com/openarena/engine
* Game code: do a Git clone on https://github.com/openarena/gamecode

With that out of the way...

# OpenArena Asset Source Repository

Here I will maintain all the work done on OpenArena, including the OACMP and some work on OA3. For maps, only the sources can be found here. If you want to check them, you need to compile them on your own.

You can do a git clone directly at the OpenArena folder. **Before you start doing any kind of work, be sure to run the Shaderlist Regenerator on the scripts folder, so you can create a new shaderlist.txt.**
