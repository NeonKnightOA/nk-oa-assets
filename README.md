# OpenArena Asset Source Repository

Here I will maintain all the work done on OpenArena, including the OACMP and some work on OA3. Only the map sources can be found here. If you want to check them, you need to compile them on your own.

You can do a git clone directly at the OpenArena folder, and it will clone everything which is needed.
