A special thank to *SoS*Adriano, skyknight and all peaple that got me suggestions and good critics on openarena.ws's forum

NB: The original skybox nebulae is affected by a little textures bug so i am using a bit changed textures that delete this bug. You can read about this bug here: http://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=3984.msg36658#msg36658
Thank Udi for solution.

Enjoy!
