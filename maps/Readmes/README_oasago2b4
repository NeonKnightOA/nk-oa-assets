Bug fixes
-------------


New in Beta 4
-------------
Back in beta stage...
Redone layout to make it easier for the engine to optimize it:
Closed windows to block vis. 
All buildings block vis. 
Added seperation between the two halfs - blocks vis.
Changed layout of buildings to block more vis. 
Granade launcher

On my machine fps only got about 15 frames extra in middle (235->250) while the bases got around 50 more frames (240->290).
But it isn't very usefull information. The new house layout might ruin the flow.

Description
-------------
A small CTF/Elimination level designed for few players. There are only two real routes to the enemy base and both can be controlled by a single player. 

The bots are not always too smart in non-CTF gametypes and so play CTF! 

I have used the castle theme (that really isn't a castle theme but I like to use them as they are)

The map is build much like: CTF-TFC-Solemn for UT2004 (Used to be a link here but Nali City is down for a long tome) but with a few changes to make it friendly the different physics of OA.

Enjoy!
