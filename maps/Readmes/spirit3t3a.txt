VERSION HISTORY
================
changes spirit3t3 -> spirit3t3a:
 * replaced the 2 teleporters between PG and LG with a short corridor
 * removed mini-corridor leading to upper teleporter
 * removed useless stairs at upper teleporter
 * switched PG and LG positions to seperate RG from LG

 * replaced glass above RA with grid to allow for interaction between the 2 levels
 * removed decorative pipes in the floor at top level
 * removed glass at all weapon markers
 * removed lights at lower level of MH room that allowed ramp jump to upper levels
 * removed concrete ramps in new PG (former LG) room that allowed ramp jump to JA and RG
 * adapted jumppad targets so you'll land on the target spot without having to use air control (all JPs)
 * sank JPs into the ground (no height difference from floor anymore)
 * added 2nd entry to RA room from SG area
 * added curves in a couple of places
 * added botclips to allow bots to go for RG/LG ammo in MH room
 * removed blood decals except for teleporter exits
 * adapted lighting in MH room
 * more clipping on the lower level
 * made +25H near RA TDM-only
