NOTES        : This map was build for the 6th mapping contest at the Quake 2 Cafe (q2c).
               Greetings to all mappers who participated and thanks to the people who organized it!
               * http://leray.proboards34.com

               This map was tested with r1q2 under win32 and with aprq2 under linux.
               * http://www.r1ch.net/stuff/r1q2/
               * http://maniac.aq2world.com/apr/

               
               I started to build the map for Quake2World (q2w) when the contest started and
               began porting it back to Quake II (q2) about 14 days before the contest ended. The q2 edition has less details and a few
               gameplay changes because q2w has faster movement and supports things that q2 doesn't.

               I encourage you to get the Quake2World version of the map! It comes with q2w, so just type 'map lilith' in
               the q2w in-game console. You'll also be able to download it from my website when the contest is over.
               See http://www.quake2world.net for more info on Quake2World.
