Thanks to those who had nice things to say about the map. 
Also to those who helped beta test it: Kle, Amphetamine,akm,spirit, and ehhh...I know Im forgetting someone...anyway thanks to you too ;)...and Id Software of course...



This map is was a geocomp4 entry. It has a somewhat limited gameplay but it look really sweat ;). 
Hats off to Infernis for making Geocomp 4 happen.



Hope you like it!
