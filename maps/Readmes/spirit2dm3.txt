A deathmatch map for Quake II  by spirit -- http://maps.rcmd.org



  "And [depicted] on the shield [of Herakles] stood the fleet-footed horses of grim Ares made gold,

   and deadly Ares the spoil-winner himself. He held a spear in his hands and was urging on the footmen:

   he was red with blood as if he were slaying living men, and he stood in his chariot.

   Beside him stood Deimos (Fear) and Phobos (Flight), eager to plunge amidst the fighting men."
   

    - Hesiod, Shield of Heracles 191
    


  " Most hateful to me are you of all gods on Olympus,

      for ever is strife dear to you and wars and fightings. "


    - Zeus to Ares. Homer, Iliad 5.890

NOTES        : Originally, this map was build for the 7th mapping contest at the Quake 2 Cafe (Q2C).
               I lacked time and didn't really like the layout though, and did not turn it in. I started working on it
               again in 2015, don't ask me why. I changed some stuff, but the layout still ain't great. It lacks a 
               proper main action room imo.
               But now too much work has been put into it, so I'll finish it for the 10th mapping contest of Q2C in 2015.

               Greetings to all mappers who participated in the contest and thanks to the people who organized it!

INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Extract the file 'spirit2dm3.zip' to your 'quake2/baseq2/' directory (preserving paths).

                 The following files will be extracted:

                     * maps/spirit2dm3.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the map
                     * maps/spirit2dm3.map -- the source file of the map (not needed to play)
                     * maps/spirit2dm3.loc -- location file for team chat messages (r1q2 and other q2 clients)

                     * docs/spirit2dm3.txt -- this readme file
                     * docs/spirit2dm3.license.txt -- the full GPL license

                     * sound/spirit2dm3/* -- the sound files for this map


              If you did it correctly, you will have the map BSP file at 'quake2/baseq2/maps/spirit2dm3.bsp'.



PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake II in-game console: 'map spirit2dm3'
                 (Note that some clients like r1q2 prefer 'gamemap spirit2dm3'.)

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 'quake2 +map spirit2dm3'

               * To start a simple server do sth like this: 'quake2 +set dedicated 1 +map spirit2dm3'

               * To play the map on public servers, cast a vote for it: 'vote map spirit2dm3'


BOT SUPPORT:

               * If you need bots try the 3ZB2 bot, it worked well for me on this map. Maybe play 1vs2 or FFA with 2.

                 Download and install 3ZB2, then:

                      shortcut/shell : 'quake2 +game 3zb2 +set deathmatch 1 +map spirit2dm3'

                 Start the game, the type the following command to add 2 bots:

                      q2 console     : 'sv spb 2'
