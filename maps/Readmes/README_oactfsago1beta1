Description
-----------
My very first try at making a level in GTK Radiant (or for any other Q3Engine game for that matter).

This alpha level is just for testing in the spirit of the Open Source principle of releasing during the development.

The bots play rather nice (attacks from all angels) but always return the flag in a straight path.

Not done:
Lightning (I have not yet fully understood how to place lightning well (or textures))

Additional comments:
map file are included (there are a little light difference in the map-file, but the light are not done anyway)

The map does not play exactly as intented the middle part should have been bigger, now all battles take place in the base halls
