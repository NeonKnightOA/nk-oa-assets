One of our way stations in dimension 17b has been overrun.
Clear it out! Oh, and stop whinging about weapons and ammo
...your a mercenary, buy your own. 

:P

Besides, there'll be plenty of hardware lying around.

DESCRIPTION: 
Single Player Level for Quake. Produced for the 100brush
v1.3 competition run by Grindspire. Although it was
originally started as an entry for the 100br v1.2 run
by XeN. I had not then learnt to love BSP =)

OTHER LEVELS BY AUTHOR (as palldjon): 
One Hundred Brush Brutality - The controversial start
map for the original Quake 100 brush competition run by
Aardappel.
abab: Abject Abcess - 9th placed entry for the original 
Quake 100 brush competition run by Aardappel.
pdbq_sp1: Recurrent Rumours - Old skool medieval SP 
level that was lauded for its interesting gameplay
situations, if not much else.

=========================================================

* Play Information *

SINGLE PLAYER: 
Yes.

COOP STARTS: 
2 - Nightmare recommended.

DEATHMATCH: 
No, I had hoped to set it up for 6-10 FFA but I really 
needed to get back to work on the QT00 mission...sorry.  

DIFFICULTY SETTINGS: 
Yes - via subtraction, substitution and one nasty little
hack. Most fun is to be had on HARD.

SECRETS:
Sort of...

TESTED ON: 
Software Quake 1.08, WinQuake, GLQuake.

KNOWN BUGS:
A couple of randomly occuring "invisible clip" bugs,
take a look at the .map and you'll understand why.
Nothing that should spoil gameplay though =)

* Construction *

BASE: 
The rotting bones of my failed 100brush v1.2 entry.

SOFTWAREZ: 
Quake (yaaaaaay for ID)
Worldcraft (thanx Ben)
TexMex (thanx Mickey)
MSPaint (thanx *cough* Bill)
WQBSP (thanx Ken and John)
Tyrlite & Rvis+ (thanx Tyrann)

TEXTURES:
Mostly Ogro2 with special guest appearances by Lunaren,
Fingers, Quernel, stecki and metlslime.

COMPILE INFO:
This was made on a Celeron P200+ with 64M SDRAM, so
you'll understand that it's painful for me to talk
about compiling.

BRUSHES: 100 (as per competition rules).
ENTITIES: More than 100.

=========================================================

* Information *

I had hoped to really extend this level by using CZG's
trick (later adopted by XeN for "Centurion") of using QEd
to provide point entity teleportation of enemy. There's
heaps of valid space in this level to house monsters for
surprise spawnings. However, as with DM implementation, 
I'd rather spend the extra time required on the QT00
mission. So, this one's just a straight out slug-fest.
Fire up track Left5 from The Fragile and go for it.

CREDITS:

Scragbait - for betaA testing, and delivering a set of
demos that showed HARD could be completed on the fourth 
attempt. Thanx bud!

Biff Debris - for betaA testing, and always greeting me
with a smile at #terrafusion.

TK - who insisted on betaB testing, which uncovered a 
"game-breaking" entity problem that would've 
disqualified this entry <beer>.

Scampie - for sending me the HUGs that kept me sane at
the eleventh hour, when VIS started telling me I was an
idiot mapper.

Fern - for the common sense advice that allowed me to
stick it back to VIS.

Grindspire - for running the show <beer*2>.

The QT00 Crate - for patiently waiting while I got this
out of my system...especially [Kona].

DEDICATIONS:

This level is dedicated to Aardappel, Vondur and Peej.

Biff wants a "full length" version of this level 
produced, so if any author wishes to grab the .map 
and use it as a base for a larger work...go right 
ahead. Just give credit where credit is due.
