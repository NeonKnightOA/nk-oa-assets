Description		: This is a small episode of Quake single player maps.
			  These were originally speedmaps (maps made in a very
			  small amount of time; usually 100 minutes).  The idea
			  was to make four speedmaps -- one in each of the
			  primary themes of Quake -- then make special
			  editions of each map, and release them as several
			  small mini-episodes.  Well, here they are.  Each map
			  has been modified to include skill settings, and each
			  map has at least one new area, plus various tweaks to
			  improve gameplay.  I also did an extra speedmap in
			  a similar theme to end.bsp (Shub-Niggurath's Pit) to
			  add a finale map to the pack.  For reference, here is
			  a list of the maps and which speedmap it is a
			  modification of:
			  
			  rpgsmse1 -- sm58_rpg2
			  rpgsmse2 -- sm56_rpg
			  rpgsmse3 -- sm57_rpg
			  rpgsmse4 -- sm58_rpg1
			  rpgsmse5 -- sm62_rpg

* NOTES *

The source .map files that have the _ character in the name are the files I
used for editing in QERadiant.  These are in the Quake 2 .map format.  The maps
that do NOT have the _ character were converted to the Quake 1 .map format by
Kristian "SleepwalkR" Duske's map converter utility.  So if you use WorldCraft
or some other editor that natively supports the Q1 .map format, load the maps
that don't have the _ character.  If you use a Quake 2 or Quake 3 editor like
QERadiant or GTKRadiant, then use the the maps that have the _ character in
file name.
