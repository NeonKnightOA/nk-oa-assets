Description		: This is the source .map for pajitnov.bsp.
			  pajitnov.map is the Quake-compatible source, and
			  pajitnov_.map is the QERadiant-compatible source
			  (I.E. it contains texture paths and surface data that
			  is used in Q2 and Q3 map editors).
Additional credits	: id Software and czg for textures; Alexey Pajitnov for
			  the idea.
Thank yous		: God, Mom, Dogfish, Jackson Tufts, Dan Smith, czg, and
			  all the testers.
Testers			: metlslime and Vondur
Previous works		: RPG3DM2; RPG3DM1; could.bsp; RPGSP1; RPG100B1;
			  contributed to SM32; a few Q1 speedmaps; an old
			  poor-quality Q2SP; an old poor-quality Q3DM; and some
			  really old Duke3D maps.

* HOW TO PLAY *

Place pajitnov.bsp in your X\quake\id1\maps\ folder (X represents the
parent directory and/or drive letter).  If you do not have one, make one.
Next, start Quake.  Once in the game press tilde (~) to bring down the
console, then type this:

skill x
map could

Then press enter.  It should load the map.
x = 0-3, 0 is easy, 1 is medium, 2 is hard, 3 is nightmare.



* TROUBLE RUNNING THE MAP *

This level probably requires extra RAM to play.  If it plays choppily or not at
all, try this (courtesy of TEAMShambler www.planetquake.com/teamshambler/):

Some levels are naturally slow due to excessive detail, or require large
amounts of RAM. To make the latter more playable in DOSQuake, add the
"-winmem xx" command to your shortcut, or these commands for a DOS prompt:

c:\>cd quake
c:\quake>quake -winmem xx

where "xx" is the amount of RAM required - most levels needing extra RAM need a
minimum of 12 meg, the more you can allocate the better. For GLQuake or
WinQuake this problem is less likely to occur, but if it does, add the
"-heapsize xx000" command to your shortcut, or these lines for a DOS prompt:

c:\>cd quake
c:\quake>glquake -heapsize xx000

where "xx000" is the amount of RAM required, measured in k, so to allocate
12 meg of RAM, use "-heapsize 12000".
