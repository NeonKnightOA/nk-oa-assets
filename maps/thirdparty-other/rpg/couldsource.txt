Description		: This is the source .map for could.bsp.  could.map
			  is the Quake-compatible source, and could_.map is
			  QERadiant-compatible source (I.E. it contains
			  texture paths and surface data that is used in Q2
			  and Q3 map editors).
Additional credits	: id Software, Speedy, metlslime, and Xatrix for the
			  textures.
Thank yous		: God, Mom, Dogfish, Jackson Tufts, Dan Smith, Speedy,
			  and all the testers.
Testers			: Shambler, Lun, Dietz, BlackPope, metlslime,

Previous works		: RPGSP1; RPG100B1; contributed to SM32; a few Q1
			  speedmaps; an old poor-quality Q2SP; an old
			  poor-quality Q3DM; and some really old Duke3D maps.
