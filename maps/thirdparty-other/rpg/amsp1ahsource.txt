* What it is, Jim? *

This is the source .map files for AMSP1: CardO the Unstoppable
Love Machine.  amsp1ah.map SHOULD be compatible with Worldcraft,
BSP, Qoole, etc, although it may have errors in those editors
that does not show up in Q3R (what I used to make the map).

amsp1ah_.map is what I used Q3R to edit, so it is in compatible
with normal Q1 editors.  All the textures for this .map should
go in \textures\am-besek\.

MapConv by SleepWalkR was used to convert amsp1ah_.map to
amsp1ah.map.  amsp1ah.map is the file that should be compatible
with Worldcraft, QuArK, etc.  This is also the file you should
use to compile with WQSBP and all the other tools.

The texture wad I used is am-besek.wad, which is included.
