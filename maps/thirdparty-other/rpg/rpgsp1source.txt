This is the source .map files for RPGSP1: Penile Devastation.
rpgsp1.map SHOULD be compatible with Worldcraft, BSP, Qoole,
etc, although it may have errors in those editors that does
not show up in Q3R (what I used to make the map).  rpgsp1_.map
is what I used Q3R to edit, and then I converted it to
rpgsp1.map to compile it with WQSBP and all the other tools.

The texture wad used I is quake101.wad and a custom wad
containing a single texture I extracted from an animating
texture in quake101.wad.  If you want/need the texture, just
extract it from the BSP, or make your own wad with a texture
by the name rpgmtlsw.

DISTRIBUTION OF ANY OF THESE FILES IN ANY WAY OR FORM IS
STRICTLY PROHIBITED!
