NOTES        : This map was made to have a map that plays well with fewer player then most
               CTF maps are designed for (usually 4vs4/5vs5).

               The map was initially designed for the idea of a 1vs1 CFT mappack over at
               q3w. It has evolved a bit and can handle more than 2 players though. I prefer
               2vs2, but you have some real intense action at 3vs3. CPM is recommended.

This map uses artwork made by the following people:

 * Quakeworld Teleporter by Jude and Decker (slightly modified by me)
 * DSI texture pack by evillair - http://evillair.net/
 * CTF textures by threewave software - http://threewavesoftware.com/
 * flares from the q3workshop flares tutorial by KnightBK - http://qworkshop3.planetquake.gamespy.com
 * the green water shader (based on an original id shader) was modofied with the help of a bunch
   of people over at q3w, including shallow, obsidian, o'dium and pjw

This CTF map was rotated using MiriX v2.0 by skwasjer:

NOTES ON THE MAKING OF THIS MAP
================================

This release includes the source files of the level, please don't abuse this (see COPYRIGHT / PERMISSIONS below). Here
is a short description of the files:

  * spirit3ctfduel1-work.map  : half of the map (the blue part), I only edit this in Radiant
  * spirit3ctfduel1.map       : the complete map (red and blue half), this file is generated by Mirix from the blue half by rotating
                                the brushes and everything. textures, spawns, location messages etc are automatically replaced/adjusted.
                                This file is compiled to the bsp file, spirit3ctfduel1.bsp
  * spirit3ctfduel1-center.map: the parts of the map in the very center of the map (the PG, SG and a launchpad) that do NOT need
                                to be duplicated and rotated by Mirix.

Other files of interest for Mirix:

  * textures.txt              : my substitution list for textures
  * spirit3ctfduel1.mir       : Mirix project file for the map, tells it what to rotate/replace/where to write output etc

VERSION HISTORY
================

changes beta1 => beta2
 * changed JPs: they have a direction now instead of pushing you upwards only
 * added 1 +25H per base (near LG / RG ammo on lower level)

 * added 1 JA in the center of the map (under the bridge)

 * minor brushwork changes at base windows
 * made passage near RG much bigger
 * made landing on bridge after PG-JP easier
