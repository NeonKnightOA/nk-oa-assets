NOTES        : I know I'm late, but I wanted to give qw mapping a try ;-)

               This is a deathmatch map for 3 - 5 players. I built it during a weekend I spend at a friend of mine. We found
               the nquake website by chance and thus re-discovered quake 1 / quakeworld. It's a simple ol' skool deathmatch map
               designed for some fun frags during LAN play - nothing more. I was drunk when I made this and it shows in parts. ;)
