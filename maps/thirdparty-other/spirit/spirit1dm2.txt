GENERAL MAP DATA
==================

MAP NAME     : spirit1dm2 / spiritqwdm2

LONGNAME     : Ultima ratio

ARCHIVE NAME : spirit1dm2.zip

VERSION      : final

GAME TYPE    : tourney (1vs1)

TEXTURES     : q1 stock textures by id (unless you got others installed)
               recommended / tested with: textures by the Quake ReteXturing Project - http://facelift.quakedev.com/

               I used these: http://facelift.quakedev.com/download/qrp-maptextures-2007-10-06r2-7files.zip

SOUNDS       : q1 stock sounds only

BASE         : none (new map from scratch)

RELEASE DATE : 18 nov 2009

NOTES        : Note that spirit1dm2 is the Quake 1 verion of this map. A slightly modified version of this map
               designed for Quakeworld, spiritqwdm2, is also included in the archive. The only difference between the maps are
               some jump distances (because some jumps of the QW version are impossible or extremely hard in Q1.)

               You can of course play the q1 version in qw but that makes these jumps pretty ridiculous.




INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Extract the file 'spirit1dm2.zip' to your 'quake/' directory (preserving paths).

                 The following files will be extracted:

                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm2.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the q1 map
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm2.map -- the source file of the q1 map (not needed to play)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm2.lit -- light file (some modern q1 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm2.dlit -- dlight file (some modern q1 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm2.way -- frikbot waypoint file (requires FrikBot)

                     * id1/maps/spiritqwdm2.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the qw map
                     * id1/maps/spiritqwdm2.map -- the source file of the qw map (not needed to play)
                     * id1/maps/spiritqwdm2.lit -- light file (modern q2 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spiritqwdm2.dlit -- dlight file (modern q2 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spiritqwdm2.way -- frikbot waypoint file (requires FrikBot)


                     * id1/docs/spirit1dm2.txt -- this readme file
                     * id1/docs/spiritqwdm2.txt -- almost empty file that tells you to read this file instead
                     * id1/docs/spirit1dm2.license.txt -- the full GPL license

                     * id1/locs/spirit1dm2.loc -- location info file for q1 map (proQuake format)
                     * id1/locs/spiritqwdm2.loc -- location info file for qw map (proQuake format)
                     * qw/locs/spirit1dm2.loc -- location info file for q1 map (Quakeworld format)
                     * qw/locs/spiritqwdm2.loc -- location info file for qw map (Quakeworld format)

                     * qw/radars/spirit1dm2.png -- radar image for q1 map (ezQuake only)
                     * qw/radars/spiritqwdm2.png -- radar image for qw map (ezQuake only)

PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake in-game console: 'map spirit1dm2'
                                                                       'map spiritqwdm2'

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 'quake +map spirit1dm2'
                                                                         'quake +map spiritqwdm2'

                 but you may want to spawn a server so your friends can connect: 'quake -listen 4 +map spirit1dm2'



PLAYING AGAINST BOTS (try it, it's easy and fun):

               * download FrikBot X - http://www.inside3d.com/frikbot/fbx/ and unzip to ...\<Quake1>\frikbot\
               * start it by double-clicking "run.bat"  (Note: You may want to adapt the executable of your favourite quake client in there.)
               * in the quake in-game console, load the map and add a bot:
                     map spirit1dm2
                     impulse 100

               That's it!

               I'm lazy so I use a shortcut on my desktop with the following command line (glpro400 is proQuake, my q1 client):
                 ...\<Quake1>\glpro400 -game frikbot -condebug -listen 16 +map spirit1dm2

FILE SIZE    : ~ 1,2 MB (zip archive)

BRUSHES      : > 950

ENTITIES     : > 240 (q1 => many point lights :|)

COMPILATION  : compiled using my cq1map shell scripts. command lines used:

               hmap2.exe spirit1dm2

NOTES        : I'm not much of a q1/qw player, sorry if I fucked things up.

               This map was designed with ol' skool q1 tourney in mind. No mods, nothing fancy. Just plain 1vs1.

               I know some of you prefer bsp files instead of zipped maps so sorry for
               all the stuff that comes with the map. :p

               Hope you like it anyway.

VERSION HISTORY
===============

* alpha1
 - layout done
 - very basic texturing and lighting
 - rough item placement

* alpha2
 - added even more point lights
 - swapped NG and SNG
 - removed 1 box of rockets
 - tons of clipping
 - added tele exit markers
 - various texture fixes
 - first try on serious spawn positions
 - increased height of skybox/upper clips

 * beta1
 - switched RL and MH (thanks Darin!)
 - switched GL and SSG
 - added JP near new RL spot
 - some texture fixes
 - added pillar in central room
 - added terrain in central room
 - switched NG and SNG
 - changed minor brushwork in new NG area
 - added some details to floor
 - dramatically improved visuals in LG area (sewer)
 - added that bridge thingie (thanks Henneck!)
 - lighting tweaks
 - changed ceiling and corridor width at new RL location
 - added many floor details and trims

 * beta2
 - fixed a critical bug with the JP (that only showed up online for some reason)

 * beta3
 - added .loc files in proQuake and ezQuake format
 - added test radar image of the map (broken atm, formula missing)

 * beta4
 - added bars add RL that block fast access to MH from upper level
 - added pipes leading up to RL area from former GL tele exit
 - added button near GL that opens RL bars (alternate route to RL)
 - changed position of GL tele exit
 - put MH into a crate, made MH area look better
 - rounded corners in sewer (LG area)
 - fixed minor texture bugs at GL tele and below NG
 - added new radar image with formula, formula is broken though
 - removed 3d trim in central atrium (height change when running over it was annoying)

 * beta5
 - fixed MH not showing up in q1 (had to move it out of the crate, no idea why)
 - finally fixed the NG spot (the steel girder it sits on is now in the middle of that gap, making the 2 jumps the same length)
 - minor lighting tweaks in central atrium (steel girders in the sky)
 - made the tiny corridor at GL tele exit a bit longer (bit more dangerous, but no need to slow down to get the turn at the end)
 - added lights to justify lightning in the same corridor and made it a bit brighter
 - fixed floor texture in that corridor
 - minor change to SNG position, just moved it away from the edge a bit (it was possible to grab it from below before)
 - fixed texture scale bug near YA (thanks =peg=)
 - slightly changed position of ammo boxes on the terrain (they semmed to be floating before)
 - removed steel thingie above RL to make the RL -> SNG jump less annoying
 - split the map into 2 different versions: one for q1 (spirit1dm2) and one for qw (spiritqwdm2), both are in the zip archive
 - in the q1 version two jumps are shorter and the MH position is changed (very slightly, no difference in gameplay) for technical reasons

 * beta6
 - fixed "ERROR: MOVETYPE_PUSH with a non bsp model" bug that would cause servers to crash from time to time (the button to open the bars pointed
   at a third, brush-less ghost entity; deleted the entity from map file with a text editor). Thanks =peg= and JPL. (Fixed in both versions of the map.)
 - added brush behind switch to make 100% sure it can't move out of the hull of the map when pressed

 * beta7
 - fixed texture alignment on teleporters and on all arches
 - replaced rusted steel textures of lamps
 - adapted architecture above LG to allow for some trick jumps (as suggested by =peg=)

 * final
 - added broken wall (missing bricks) near LG
 - spiced up the LG area a bit more (cables)
 - fixed pitch black spot on crates above LG
 - more minor lighting and texture alignment fixes
 - added frikbot waypoint files, made by Lightning_Hunter
 - updated readme file


TODO list
==========

- fix radar image (I got no idea how to do that atm, QWLM won't load my radar image properly for unknown reasons.)
- fix darkplaces rendering bugs (Get rid of the small, white, flickering lines below RL and on pipes at LG. No idea either.)
- have some coffee
