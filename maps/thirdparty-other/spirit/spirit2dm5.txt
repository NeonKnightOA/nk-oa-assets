               Yes, it *does* have many weapons and quite a bit of ammo for its size - but I hate
               both the blaster and the time it takes to switch your weapon (like when you're out of ammo) in Q2...




INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Extract the file 'spirit2dm5.zip' to your 'quake2/baseq2/' directory (preserving paths). Done.

                 The following files will be extracted:

                     * maps/spirit2dm5.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the map
                     * maps/spirit2dm5.map -- the source file of the map (not needed to play)
                     * maps/spirit2dm5.loc -- location file for team chat messages (r1q2 and other q2 clients)

                     * docs/spirit2dm5.txt -- this readme file
                     * docs/spirit2dm5.license.txt -- the full GPL license

                     * env/spirit2dm5/* -- the skybox files for this map

                     * sound/spirit2dm5/* -- the sound files for this map

                     * textures/spirit2dm5/* -- the texture files for this map




PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake II in-game console: 'map spirit2dm5'
                 (Note that some clients like r1q2 prefer 'gamemap spirit2dm5'.)

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 'quake2 -listen 8 +map spirit2dm5'

               * Bots suck but if you really need one try the 3ZB2 bot, it worked ok for me (though it
                 doesn't seem to like JPs and spends way too much time in the central water trap).
                 You'll need more than one bot, they are too stupid to play them 1vs1.

                 Download and install 3ZB3, then:

                      shortcut   : 'quake2 +game 3zb2 +set deathmatch 1 +map spirit2dm5'
                      q2 console : 'sv spb 2'
