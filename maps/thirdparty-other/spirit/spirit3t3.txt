 * added DFSP sign
 * added weapon marker on the ground at PG
 * added sky at YA/MH room

    doubt anyone will ever play this map in TDM)

 * fixed some texture issues near RA
 * moved teleporter destinations down to the floor
 * placed RG-ammo (instead of SG-ammo) in compartment (YA/MH room)
 * moved plasma and and SG ammo around
 * made GL (and 5Hs next to it) easier to grab

thanks to v1l3 for many suggestions.

 * added blood decals (texture by broar, modified by me) to mark tele exits
 * added pipe details in the floor at upper level

changes beta5 -> beta6:
 * replaced water at RA with lava
 * re-design of RA area makes RA more dangerous to get and make RA <--> MH longer

 * ramp/double jump from LG to RG now possible
 * TDM-only changes: added Quad, moved LG around
