INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Unzip the archive to your '<your_quake2_dir>' directory preserving paths. You're done.

               The following files will be installed:

               * '<your_quake2_dir>/baseq2/maps/spirit2dm1.bsp' (the mapfile)
               * '<your_quake2_dir>/baseq2/maps/spirit2dm1.txt' (this readme)
               * '<your_quake2_dir>/baseq2/maps/spirit2dm1.license' (full GPL license)
               * '<your_quake2_dir>/eraser/routes/spirit2dm1.rtz' (routes table for eraser bots, see BOTS below)
               * '<your_quake2_dir>/baseq2/maps/spirit2dm1.loc' (location file for r1q2 and other q2 clients)

PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake II in-game console: '/map spirit2dm1'

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 
               
                   - to play the map alone (rather boring, see BOTS below to play against bots): 'quake2 +map spirit2dm1'

                   - to start a local server with the map: 'quake2 +set deathmatch 1 +map spirit2dm1'

                   - to start a local dedicated server with the map (you won't be able to play on the box you run this command on,
                     only players from other machines can connect to it): 'quake2 +set dedicated 1 +set deathmatch 1 +map spirit2dm1'


BOTS:          The map works well with the Eraser Bot for Quake II.
               Google for sth. like 'eraser bot 1.01 final' if you don't have it.

               Atm (03/2007), these links work:
               linux: http://www.airrocket.net/mirror/quake2/bots/eraser_1.01_linux.zip
               win32: http://www.airrocket.net/mirror/quake2/bots/eraser_1.01_win32.zip

               To start the map with bots: 'quake2 +set game eraser +map spirit2dm1',
               then add bots with the bot_num command from the in-game console: 'bot_num 2'.

               Note that Eraser Bots use route tables to navigate maps.
               If you unzipped the 'spirit2dm1-full.zip' archive to your quake 2 directory preserving paths, a route table for
               my map should already exist at '<your_quake2_dir>/eraser/routes/spirit2dm1.rtz'.
               Creating your own tables is easy though, it boils down to running around the map
               using different paths the first time you start it with the Eraser Mod, then reload
               QuakeII or the map and play.
               See the Eraser documentation for more info.
