INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Extract the file 'spirit2dm6.zip' to your 'quake2/baseq2/' directory (preserving paths). Done.

                 The following files will be extracted:

                     * maps/spirit2dm6.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the map
                     * maps/spirit2dm6.map -- the source file of the map (not needed to play)
                     * maps/spirit2dm6.loc -- location file for team chat messages (r1q2 and other q2 clients)

                     * docs/spirit2dm6.txt -- this readme file
                     * docs/spirit2dm6.license.txt -- the full GPL license

                     * textures/spirit2dm6/* -- textures for this map

                     * sound/spirit2dm6/* -- sounds for this map

                     * env/spirit2dm6/* -- environment map (sky) for this map


PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake II in-game console: 'map spirit2dm6'
                 (Note that some clients like r1q2 prefer 'gamemap spirit2dm6'.)

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 'quake2 +map spirit2dm6'

               * To start a simple server do sth like this: 'quake2 +set dedicated 1 +map spirit2dm6'

               * To play the map on public servers, cast a vote for it: 'vote map spirit2dm6'

               * If you need bots try the 3ZB2 bot, it worked surprisingly well for me on this map. It doesn't
                 seem to do the jumps to RG and BA too often but it's still great fun if you play against two of 'em!

                 Download and install 3ZB3, then:

                      shortcut/shell : 'quake2 +game 3zb2 +set deathmatch 1 +map spirit2dm6'
                      q2 console     : 'sv spb 2'
