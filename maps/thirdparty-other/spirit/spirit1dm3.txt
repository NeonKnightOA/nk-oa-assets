INSTALLATION AND HOW TO PLAY
=============================

INSTALL:

               * Extract the file 'spirit1dm3.zip' to your 'quake/' directory (preserving paths).

                 The following files will be extracted:

                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm3.bsp -- the bsp file needed to play the q1 map
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm3.map -- the source file of the q1 map (not needed to play)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm3.lit -- light file (some modern q1 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm3.dlit -- dlight file (some modern q1 clients only, e.g. darkplaces)
                     * id1/maps/spirit1dm3.wa* -- frikbot waypoint files (requires FrikBotX)

                     * id1/docs/spirit1dm3.txt -- this readme file
                     * id1/docs/spirit1dm3.license.txt -- the full GPL license

                     * id1/locs/spirit1dm3.loc -- location info file for q1 map (NQ format, made with qrack)
                     * qw/locs/spirit1dm3.loc -- location info file for q1 map (QW format, made with ezQuake)

                     + the same stuff for spirit1t3

PLAY:
               * You can load the map using the Quake in-game console: 'map spirit1dm3'

               * You can also start it from the command line of your OS: 'quake +map spirit1dm3'

                 but you may want to spawn a server so your friends can connect: 'quake -listen 4 +map spirit1dm3'
                 
               * come to http://www.quakeone.com or http://www.quakeworld.nu to find servers to play online



PLAYING AGAINST BOTS (try it, it's easy and fun):

               * download FrikBot X - http://www.inside3d.com/frikbot/fbx/ and unzip to ...\<Quake1>\frikbot\
               * start it by double-clicking "run.bat"  (Note: You may want to adapt the executable of your favourite quake client in there.)
               * in the quake in-game console, load the map and add a bot:
                     map spirit1dm3
                     impulse 100

               That's it!

               I'm lazy so I use a shortcut on my desktop with the following command line (glpro400 is proQuake, my Quake client):
                 ...\<Quake1>\glpro400 -game frikbot -condebug -listen 8 +map spirit1dm3

COMPILATION  : compiled using my cq1map shell scripts, took ~ 10 mins

NOTES        : This map was designed with ol' skool q1 tourney or FFA in mind. No mods, nothing fancy.

               I know some of you prefer bsp files instead of zipped maps so sorry for
               all the stuff that comes with the map. Yes, it's even more than last time. :p

               Hope you like it anyway.
