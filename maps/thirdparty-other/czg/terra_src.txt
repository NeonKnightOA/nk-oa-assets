These are the map sources for the terra map pack. Comes in both .MAP format and .RMF format for worldcraft.

Feel free to do whatever you desire with them, but please, give me some credit, will ya?
Common decency applies here.

Textures may be extracted from the .BSP's if there is anyone I used that are not in original Quake wad.
