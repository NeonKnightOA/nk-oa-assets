Description
-----------
My very first try at making a level in GTK Radiant (or for any other Q3Engine game for that matter).

This is the map I tested double domination on.

Persistant powerups is only in missionpack or with a new version of OAX

The bots play rather nice (attacks from all angels) but always return the flag in a straight path.

Additional comments:
map file is included
