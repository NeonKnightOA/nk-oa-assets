description "In the wake of the invasion, the Master ordered that every dissenting member of the Force should be sent to the Nether Prison, located below Sago's Castle. The area is known for the high number of casualties, product of the constant inmate infighting, which ended with a special portion of the location being turned into a combat arena."
