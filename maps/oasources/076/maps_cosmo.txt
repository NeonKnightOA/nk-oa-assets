Comment:    I started to map again after
    I realized that quake spirit never dies.
    My bad manners: 'never release your first
    map' ignored. I liked to do something with
    only 2 or 3 textures. I didn't succeed well.

Comment:    I went into the process of texture
    making and I got pretty annoyed by it
    especially because I'm not satisfied with my
    outcome. CTF maps need more than two ways to
    reach each base which I tried to balance.

Source:     new map from scratch
Type:       FFA, Tourney
Size:       suitable for 2 - 6 players
Bots:       available
Buildtime:  6 days
Special:    Inspired by q3dm6

            Ylle, dmn_clown
Comment:    This time I had something very plain
    and simple in my mind. All surfaced should be
    clean and featureless. So I went for a little
    factorythemed arena losely based on an often
    played map by ID. My map didn't turn out that
    big and enjoyable as I wanted it to be in the
    beginning.

Full name:  Repulsion
Source:     new map from scratch
Type:       FFA, Team
Size:       suitable for 4 - 16 players
Bots:       available
Buildtime:  3 weeks
Special:    King Of The Hill themed
Credits:    Astro, ^_^, Ylle, antisocialist, kick52,
            kit89, baronofhell, pulchr, Derity,
            andrewj, Joshua
Comment:    I like the idea of 'King of the hill'
    so I wanted to make a map of that type despite
    Open Arena is lacking such gametype. I still
    got another map on paper with the same topic.
    Used photos as texturesources which I was used
    to when mapping once before. I liked to have a
    BFG placed on the hill but for balancing reasons
    it's just Quad Damage Powerup.



Mapname:    ctf_inyard
Full name:  Inner Yard
Source:     new map from scratch
Type:       CTF
Size:       suitable for 4 - 12 players
Bots:       available
Buildtime:  3 days
Special:    Strafejump parcour
Credits:    kit89, Astro, gismo, andrewj, Snickersnack,
Comment:    Started to create this one after OA 0.76
    releasedate was anounced. I had the whole structure
    in my mind even before I placed the first brush.
    I only had troubles placing items to balance
    gameplay.



Mapname:    wrackdm17
Full name:  Never Ending Yard
Source:     map based on Nexiuz
Type:       FFA, Team, Tourney
Size:       suitable for 2 - 8 players
Bots:       available
Buildtime:  1 day
Special:    Tried to give some used look.
Credits:    Nexiuz Team, leilol, dmn_clown, kit89
Comment:    I never liked q3dm17. The map I got from
    leilol comes from Nexiuz and is slightly bigger
    compared to the original. I guess I failed to give
    it an unique look although I replaced lots of brush
    work and lowered railgun platform. If I ever lay
    my hands on this I would recreate the map from
    scratch.
