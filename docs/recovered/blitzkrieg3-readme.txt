Map released under GPLv2.

Liner notes from boxaeq himself.
"I played q3 - cpma a lot a long time ago. I was very impresed by some maps (cpm1, cpm3) made by Jude, they were so playable, with so many tricks. An idea to create this map was always in my head, now finaly an idea is in blitzkrieg.pk3.

Blitzkrieg is a very simple map, with no special effects, that's because i'm an engineer not an artist. I'm sure it's not free of bugs. But what i'm also sure i that blitzkrieg is very very playable map, it's free of "camperplaces" and rooms that you never enter to. Those who like triks will not be disapointed."
