Older mappacks also had the following discontinued maps. You can find them at the OpenArena forums (http://www.openarena.ws/board) and my blog: (http://armageddonman.blogspot.com)
- am_harv-sod: An experiment about the Harvester gametype, which allowed for unconventional CTF layouts.
- am_icyhell: An attempt to do an icy map.
- dm4ishv2: Changes & improvements towards dm4ish. It was discontinued.
- oa_dm1v2: Changes & improvements towards oa_dm1. kit89 is doing another version and I'm helping him with that one.
- oa_dm5v2: Changes & improvements over oa_dm5. It was discontinued.
- q3dm6ishv3: Retexturizing and improvements over q3dm6ish/v2. Since Q3 remakes will be left out from further versions, this one has been discontinued.
- q3dm6ish-ctf: A mirrored CTF version of q3dm6ish. Discontinued for the same reasons as q3dm6ishv3.

There was also extra stuff such as new/improved GFX, but Udi took on these and his 0.8.5 work is better than what I've made.

== Notes ==
Since the first map I've done for OA, I've never stopped to do things. After sawing am_galmevish included in 0.8.1, I had enough motivation to make maps and stuff for this game. And look: nonetheless and nonethemore than 19/20 maps!!! 14 of them will be included in the next versions of OA, and some of them have reached the "Final" status, for my own happiness. ^^ Anyway, this is my work, enjoy it. ^^

About the sources:
Maps: These are located under the sources folder.
Models: The models I've made are located under the sources\models folder. The readmes for each map also specify who is the owner of which work.
Textures: There isn't much sources, just the oa_bod ones, which are found at http://www.onykage.com/files/armageddonman/oa_bod-a1-sources.zip. In most cases, with the textures, I've worked over the finished textures, so these ARE the source.
Most of the remaining sources can also be found at http://www.openarena.ws/svn.
