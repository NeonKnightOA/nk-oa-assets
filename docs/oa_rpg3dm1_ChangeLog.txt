      Made the blocks around staircase near RL use dark_tin2 texture.

      use 'Natural' mode for the scaling and offsets.

      Worked on area underneath the LG

    7 Andrew Apted	2009-12-31

      Rotated the whole map by 180 degrees, which produces better lighting
      from the nebula3 sky.  (I had to rotate some entities manually, stupid
      damn NetRadiant).

    4 Andrew Apted	2009-12-31
      Moved the destination of the teleporter near the megahealth, it now goes
      upstairs near the shotgun instead of outside near the RL.  This is my
      attempt to improve gameplay -- before most of the action occurred only
      in the lowest areas (especially around the RL).
