Map released under GPLv2.

Notes:
Created from scratch, based on reptctf3 by Firethrottle. The original map can be found here: http://lvlworld.com/review.php?id=1600. Unfortunately, I couldn't contact him to ask if he could release his two maps (reptctf11 and reptctf3) under GPLv2, so I had to do everything from scratch. Eventually both maps ended being completely different compared to the original ones.
