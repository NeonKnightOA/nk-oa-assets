Nailgun ammo. Gives the player 25 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : value is the time in seconds before the item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : a random time variance in seconds is added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 10).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
notbot: (NEW KEY PROPERTY) when set to 1, a bot will never seek out this item.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).

SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
