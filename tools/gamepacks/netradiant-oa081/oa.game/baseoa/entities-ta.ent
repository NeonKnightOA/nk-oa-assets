-------- KEYS --------
<real key="wait" name="Respawn Delay">time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).</real>

<integer key="count" name="Ammo Given">sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 10).</integer>
<string key="team" name="Team Name">set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).</string>
<target key="target" name="Target">picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.</target>
<targetname key="targetname" name="Target Name">a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.</targetname>
<boolean key="notbot" name="Invisible To Bots">used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.</boolean>
<boolean key="notfree" name="Hidden For FFA">when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.</boolean>

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).
