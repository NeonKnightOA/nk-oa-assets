q3 mapping helper scripts by spirit
====================================

about:
------------------
this is a small collection of scripts that will automate various 
q3a mapping tasks for your under linux.

these are shell scripts for the linux bash shell. do not try to run
them under win32 and do NOT email me to tell me that they don't work
under win32.

quick usage info:
------------------
unzip scripts, make them executable and copy them to your baseq3 dir.



detailed explanation of the setup:
-----------------------------------
1) unzip scripts (assuming you downloaded to your home directory):
    user@box$> cd
    user@box$> tar xzf q3scripts.tar.gz
2) place scripts directly in your '~/.q3a/baseq3/' directory
    user@box$> cd ~/.q3a/baseq3/
    user@box$> cp ~/q3scripts/* .
3) make scripts executable 
    user@box$> chmod u+x <scriptname>
4) use scripts (in baseq3)
    user@box$> ./<scriptname> <parameter>


some words on the individual scripts and what they do for you
--------------------------------------------------------------

- backupmap ('./backupmap <mapname>'):
  will write copies of your map and pk3 files of <mapname> to a 
  backupdir (defaults to '.backup/', note the dot!) and append the
  current date and time to the filenames

- genbots ('./genbots <mapname>'):
  will generate a botfile (.aas) for your map (needs bsp-file of course)
  
- makepk3 ('./makepk3 <mapname>'):
  will generate a pk3 file of the directory structure for your map

- makemap ('./makemap <mapname>'):
  will NOT auto-build a map in radiant for you, sorry ;-). will however 
  use the .map-file to compile .bsp and then run the 'rendermap', 'genbots' and 'makepk3'
  scripts for you (thus depends on them of course).

- renamemap ('./renamemap <mapname> <newmapname>'):
  will copy various files of your map to match the new mapname.
  could need some improvements, see the file for details.

- rendermap ('./rendermap <mapname> [<quality>]'):
  will run q3map2 to render the map with a quality setting
  of your choice.

- rmunusedtex ('./rmunusedtex <mapname> <dir> [<delete>]'):
  will remove textures that are not used by the specified mapfile and
  reside in <dir>. won't delete anything but print infos on the texture usage
  only unless you set <delete> to 'yes'. will make a backup of the
  whole <dir> prior to deleting stuff to $BACKUPDIR (defaults to $HOME).
  
- testmodmap ('./testmodmap <map> <mod>'):
  will run your map file (bsp in baseq3/maps/ or pk3 in baseq3/) in <mod>.
  will set 'sv_pure 0' and run your special map testing q3config if any.


see the script files for some more info. scripts will tell you what to expect from them and how to use them when you run them without any arguments.
